# Colossal News Feed
An assignment to connect with a news feed using react. I have used the news feed from Colossal (http://www.thisiscolossal.com/).

### Extra
After the assignment I tweaked the style and layout. With Material UI I changed the look and with Masonry I was able get the grid working like Pinterest. 

### React Starter - Installation

```bash
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```
